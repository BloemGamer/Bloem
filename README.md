# Bloem

Bloem is a very basic intcode/assembly like, C++ interpreted programming language I made because I was bored.
The language uses memory cells and pointer systems to opperate basic functionality. It also has a very easy way to implement C++ code.

> [!NOTE]
> The language still is in development, en not everything is working as it should, or will be implemented
